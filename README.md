# External Affairs
The following read.me outlines the development of the northeastern university external affairs web site.  Please read through this document thoroughly and let us know if there are any questions.


## Our Development Process
Our development process consists of the following tools:
..* Github, usually public repositories
..* Deploy Buddy, to automagically push edits merged to the development master branch to the test server
..* WP Migrate DB Pro, to synchronize any database and uploads changes from development to test and vice-versa
